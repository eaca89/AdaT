Need to register on firebase (see this link: https://blog.csdn.net/u012934325/article/details/71721304) for building the apk.

It will generate two apk files (both works):

	./app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk (we use this one)

	./scarlet/build/outputs/apk/full/debug/scarlet-full-debug.apk
